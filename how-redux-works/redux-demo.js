const redux = require('redux');

// Reducer function - Should be a pure function.  Same input leads to the same output.  There should be no side effects, so no writing to local storage, making an api call etc...
// Inputs: Old State + Dispatched Action  ---> Output: New state object.

const counterReducer = () => {};

const store = redux.createStore();
